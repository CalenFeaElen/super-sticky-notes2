This was originally a class project for Skillcrush using React and CodeSandBox.  Using Node.js and Next.js I redid the project locally with React hooks. It utilizes usehooks-ts to store the notes in Local Storage.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
